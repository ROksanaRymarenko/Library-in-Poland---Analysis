# Library-in-Poland---Analysis

The notebook works with datasets containing information about libraries in Poland and statistics data about population by province/voivodeship.

Libraries are a very important institution in Poland. They are not only the place established for borrowing books, but they are the public-oriented culture-promoting centres.

Some of the libraries have the quite innovative environment and well designed. Their cosy spaces are divided into zones, including the shelves with the books, the reading rooms, librarian’s desks, the children’s corners, the media libraries, the computer work stations, the conference halls, the photographic and artistic studios, the galleries and the cafés.

Every library has some key performance indicators (KPI) that help evaluate the effectiveness of its strategy and tactics. We don't have any information about Poland's libraries KPI, but we can use the open data to try to analyze libraries' success.

The libraries have the need to involve the community in the library’s activity.
Let's check the numbers of libraries per 1000 people.
Do people with disabilities have an access to the libraries?
Library collection is a foundational to being able to build successful services and communities. Classical metrics for the libraries is the collection size and the number of materials circulated. Let's check
how many loans the libraries have?
how many books per reader the libraries have?
I this data set we don't have such metrics as user satisfaction, user participation, user support, user development, the staff satisfaction, but we have such metrics as
the number of trained staff and we can calculate - Number of librarians per 100 readers.

For each province/voivodeship we are going to calculate and visualize some mentrics and indicators.
1. Comparison of involving the community in the library’s activity
2. Availability of libraries for people with disabilities
3. Comparison of the number of trained staff per 100 readers
4. Calculating the сlassical metrics for the libraries:
- the collection size - how many books per reader the libraries have?
- the number of materials circulated - how many loans the libraries have?
5. To determine three most successful provinces. The indicators we take into consideration:
- Amount of libraries per 1000 people
- Amount of books per 100 readers
- The number of trained staff per 100 readers
- The number of libraries with facilities for people with disabilities

We're going to get top three provinces/voivodeships - which are the most effective in attracting the inhabitants and the readers to reading.

The result is:
Top three voivodeships: Lubielskie, Śiewtokrzyckie, Zachodnipomorskie
